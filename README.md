# RtestML

This is a basic ML stroke prediction model made in R. 

-What it does.

This project uses machine learning (random forest) in order to predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke.

-Includes

1. Stroke prediction model.
2. A file for randomly generating a data table with made up patient health data(This is used to teach the model which persons are most likely to have a stroke)
3.README file

-How to use

First use a R compatible IDE like Pycharm (with R extension), Rstudio and RStudio cloud.
Install packages associated with the libraries
Go to StrokeTablegenerator.R, run page to create a dataframe of randomized stroke data.
Go to StrokeModel.R to run the ML model.
